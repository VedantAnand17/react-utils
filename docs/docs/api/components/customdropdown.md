# CustomDropdown
```tsx
import { CustomDropdown } from '@dr.pogodin/react-utils';
```
The [CustomDropdown] component implements a themable dropdown input,
constructed from scratch based on simple `<div>` elements, rather than
using the native `<select>` element as the native [Dropdown] component does.

For now, refer to the [Dropdown] documentation for further details.
