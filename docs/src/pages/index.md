# Dr. Pogodin's React Utils
[@dr.pogodin/react-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dr.pogodin/react-utils)
is yet another [ReactJS] development kit. It provides a selection of
[components](/docs/api#components),
[configurations](/docs/api#configs),
[functions](/docs/api#functions),
[scripts](/docs/api#scripts),
[styles](/docs/api#styles),
and [utilities](/docs/api#utils)
routinely necessary in most [ReactJS] projects.

It is intended for a freelance developer who has to rapidly prototype and
then simultaneously develop and maintain different [ReactJS] projects at
the same time. The aim is:
1.  To ensure the same tooling and developer experience across multiple
    independent projects relying on the library, at least as far as generic
    web app programming with [ReactJS] is concerned.
2.  To provide efficient solution of common challenges in web app programming
    with [ReactJS].
3.  To facilitate updates of dependencies across multiple independent project.

In particular, this library and related [starter pack] cover:
- Code splitting.
- Efficient global state management (with help of [React Global State] library).
- Generally useful components and helper functions.
- Hot Module Reloading (HMR) in development mode.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- Visual context and _ad hoc_ theming of reusable components (via [React Themes]
  library).
- _etc._

The current documentation is not the strong point of the library, as it is
currently a one-man project, used in personal and some commercial projects.
Thus, the documentation serves as a good reference for a user with deep
knowledge of the library, but not that good for a newcomer.
