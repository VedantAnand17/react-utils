## Installation
Install the package as
```bash
$ npm install --save @dr.pogodin/react-utils
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dr-pogodin-lib-setup
```
Then import the global stylesheet into the root ReactJS component of your app:
```jsx
/* eslint-disable global-require */
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  require('@dr.pogodin/react-utils/dist/prod/style.css');
} else {
  require('@dr.pogodin/react-utils/dist/dev/style.css');
}
/* eslint-enable global-require */
```

To upgrade this library to the latest version just execute again
```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dr-pogodin-lib-setup
```

## Development

Whenever you are to do any changes in the library, keep in mind the following:

- Different projects rely on this library, the tooling it provides should be as
  generic and flexible as possible. When you change existing components, do your
  best to keep backward compatibility of the updated components, any changes
  that demand updates in the projects relying on the library, must be
  documented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

- Rely on unit tests to verify your changes, and prevent regression. Update
  existing unit tests to keep up with your changes, and add new unit tests
  when necessary.

- For the final testing of your updates within a host project relying on this
  lib, see the next section.

- The library use semantic versioning. In case your changes demand any changes
  in the project relying on the library, you should release it as a minor
  library update (more severe comparing to patch update). Consider to use
  a new branch, called after the minor version, and to not merge your changes
  into the main **develop** / **master** branches until everybody is prepared
  for that.

### Local Testing of Library Updates within a Host Project

To locally test how your library updates work within a host project relying on
the lib (without releasing them to NPM), use
[`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html) to link local copy of the lib
into the host project, then run `npm run build:dev:watch` in the library root to
automatically re-build the lib when you change it, and use the host project to
see the final effect of changes you make.

### Library Releases to NPM

Continious Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) is set up for this repository with
CircleCI 2.0. Commits to all branches trigger testing of the code with
`$ npm test` (it runs linters and unit tests), and also build the library.
CI/CD flow is interrupted in case of any problems.

To release updated library version to NPM do the following:

- Bump library version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` by
  `$ npm version UPDATE_TYPE --no-git-tag` command, where `UPDATE_TYPE` should
  be one of `patch` / `minor` / `major` to update current version `x.y.z`
  to `x.y.(z+1)` / `x.(y+1).0` / `(x+1).0.0`. The `--no-git-tag` flag prevents
  automatic creation of the Git tag with the same name as the version.

- Tag the commit to be released with the git tag like `v0.1.2`, where `0.1.2` is
  the new version set in the previous step.

- Commit the tag to GitHub repository.
