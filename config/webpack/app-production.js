 *  The following options are accepted:
 *
 * @param {Object|String|String[]} ops.entry Entry points. If an object is
 *  passed, in the "polyfills" entry point will be extended or appended to
 *  include some polyfills we consider obligatory. If a string or an array is
 *  passed in, it will be turned into "main" entry point, and the "polyfills"
 *  entry point will be added to it.
 *
 * @param {String} ops.context Base URL for resolution of relative
 *  config paths.
 *
 * @param {String} ops.publicPath Base URL for the output of the build assets.
